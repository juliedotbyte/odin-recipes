# odin-recipes

<!-- Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.) -->

This is my first HTML Activity in The Odin Project. The activity is all about listing our favourite dishes. Then, each dishes should be clickable as a link that redirects us to find the picture, description, recipe, ingredients, and steps regarding that dish. The website is simply done in HTML format and file only. The practices I did are the following:

1. Created a directory called odin-recipes (what I imported from my github repository)

2. Created index.html as my homepage. Inside the index.html, I created the HTML boilerplate (basic structure). Then inserted a heading 1 element called Odin Recipes. 

3. Below the heading, I created an unordered list, and listed three links about my favourite dishes. The links are a relative link because they are an HTML documents within the same root directory. 

4. Each of those links contain the name, picture, decription, ingredients, and steps. 

5. I also followed the correct file structure, wherein the index is simply within the root directory: odin-recipes/index.html

6. While the other documents such as my favourite three dishes are contained in another direcotry within the root directory called "recipes": odin-recipes/recipes/chicken-fried-chicken.html (for example).

7. While the images are also stored in another directory inside the root directory called "img": odin-recipes/img/chicken-fried-chicken.jpeg (for example).


Other practices I forgot to mention: 

1. I applied all the learnings I got from the HTML materials under foundation curriculum. I applied the boilerplate, headings (especially h1 and h3 for my project), paragraphs, order and unordered list, img element, anchor element, and html attributes. 

2. After the project, I committed all of it in my repository hosted by github.
